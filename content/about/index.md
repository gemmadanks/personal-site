Welcome to my personal website!

I am a scientist and software engineer, with a background in [artificial intelligence](/projects/ai-consultancy) and [marine developmental genomics](/projects/academic-research). I currently work full time at the [SKA Observatory](https://www.skao.int/en), designing and building [software for radio astronomy](/projects/software-radio-astronomy).

I wrote my first computer program to model the diving behaviour of fur seals as a biology undergraduate and since then I've had a passion for building software that can predict patterns in data, test hypotheses and make discoveries. My mission is to use my skills to contribute to the search for life elsewhere of life in the universe.

In my spare time I also work on my own [open research](https://open-research.gemmadanks.com) and [open source](https://github.com/gemmadanks/python-project-template) projects and an [outreach site](https://palebluemarbles.com) for cultivating curiosity in children.
