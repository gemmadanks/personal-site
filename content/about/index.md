I work at the [SKAO](https://www.skao.int/en), where I design and build software to process the extreme volumes of data that will flow from the largest radio telescopes in the world.

Some other things I enjoy include:

- Spending time with my family
- Hiking in mountains
- Fantasy and science fiction
- Wildlife gardening
- Open research
- Running
- Stargazing
- Learning Swedish

Originally from the Shropshire countryside in England, I lived in Norway for twelve years and relocated back to the U.K. in 2021. 

I have a Ph.D. in Biology from the University of York, England and spent over eight years as a postdoctoral researcher studying the developmental genomics of Oikopleura dioica. Following this, I spent seven years in industry working as a consultant in artificial intelligence and data engineering. I am also director of [octofox.ai](https://octofox.ai).
