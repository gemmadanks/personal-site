In my academic research, I explored some of the fundamental properties of life on Earth -- focussing on its genetic blueprint -- which involved modelling, processing and analysing large genomic data sets.

You can read more about my PhD research on protein folding and my postdoctoral research on developmental genomics at the links below.

I have a [separate site](https://open-research.gemmadanks.com) I use as an open lab book for my current independent research project on technosignatures, which focuses on the search for life beyond Earth.
