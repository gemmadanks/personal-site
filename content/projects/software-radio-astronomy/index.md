I currently work full-time as a data processing software engineer at the SKA Observatory’s global headquarters at Jodrell Bank, UK.

My role involves designing and building software systems to handle the enormous volumes of data that will be produced by the world’s largest radio telescopes -- contributing to the SKAO’s mission to transform our understanding of the universe and participating in one of the most ambitious science projects in history.

You can read more about the [SKAO here](https://skao.int) and learn about our software development on our [developer portal here](https://developer.skao.int/en/latest/) or check out some of the open source repositories I've contributed towards on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gemmadanks):
