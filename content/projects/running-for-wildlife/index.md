This year I’ll be running my second marathon, in Chester, UK — raising money to support wild animals and hoping to stay injury-free on the long runs. I enjoy the challenge and it helps me stay healthy and spend more time outdoors, with my energetic border collie as my enthusiastic pacer.

I ran my first marathon in 2023 when I raised money for Wild Animal Initiative.
