My consultancy work in artificial intelligence and data engineering honed my skills in designing and implementing algorithms and pipelines for large-scale data processing, with a focus on delivering high-quality software in production environments.

I spent 7 years as a senior consultant -- working on projects for international clients in the biotechnology, engineering, power, finance, service and transport sectors. I also co-founded and still serve as director of [Octofox AI](https://octofox.ai). 

In 2021, I was named one of [Norwayâ€™s leading women in tech](https://www.abelia.no/50techkvinner/karede/).
