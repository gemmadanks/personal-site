As a senior consultant in machine learning, I specialised in big data processing, deep learning and planning machine learning projects and have expertise in productivising data pipelines and machine learning solutions on several major cloud platforms including Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure Databricks.

Below are some of the key projects I've worked on. I also used machine learning in my academic research, which you can read about [here](/projects/research).

You can watch a webinar I did with a colleague on how to plan machine learning projects and avoid common pitfalls [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psb0EHJ9yJM).

## Data pipelines for estimating passengers on trains
I was the lead architect for developing a cloud-based data platform, data pipelines and machine learning models for a national railway directorate to help them monitor and estimate passengers on trains.

## Deep learning for engine health management
I developed deep learning models for monitoring engines onboard marine vessels and in power stations across the globe for an international world-leading engineering company. The models detect anomalies in real-time, classify faults and predict the remaining useful life of key components.

## Deep learning for protein design
I developed algorithms and deep learning models for protein design for a biotech company. This included the use of large protein language models.

## Data platform and machine learning for estimating customer traffic
I maintained and extended the cloud-based data platform of an expanding international company in the service sector with a strong focus on data-driven decision-making. I also utilised machine learning and optimisation to help them run and scale their business more effectively.

## Machine learning for personal finance
I led a team of developers and data scientists at a rapidly expanding FinTech startup to help them establish the infrastructure for integrating machine learning into their finance mobile app. 

## Machine learning for district heating
I performed exploratory data analysis and provided advice on tools and methods to help a large company in the renewable energy industry understand the factors associated with under-street heating in Norway.
